# Data dictionary

All data is generated and fictional; see "About this data" in README.md.

Files starting with `network_` and the energy, growth and investment files cover all 100 sites. The other files are close-up detail for sites S1–S5.

Units: kW = power, kWh = energy, MWh = 1 000 kWh, SoC = state of charge in % of battery capacity. `ts` = timestamp, Finnish time (UTC+2). A 15-minute row covers the 15 minutes starting at `ts`.
